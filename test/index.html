			<h1>Hello there,<h1><h3>I'm testing my gifs.</h3><br>
			<p>So things and words and stuff. I made this once upon a time and shit. in like my internship and whatevs yo. gifs are great for logos and things of the sort. But i thought png was better? or not? Traditional logos can be great for gifs. Jpegs are like lossy and stuff but great for images and whatever yo. PNG is for transparancy. Scalable Vector Graphics:SVG omg the futureeee. ICO is favicon (the only time you would use it) what the fucks is that.</p>
