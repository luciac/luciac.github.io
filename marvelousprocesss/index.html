	<h2>In the Beginning</h2>
	<h3>Coming up with the idea</h3>
	<p>When Captain America 2: Winter Soldier came out, I took my mother to see it. She has no idea what Marvel even is. She has never heard of Captain America. So for the entirety of the film, I gave my mother buckets of back story. Most of the characters come from previous films, the main antagonist of the film is from the first Captain America. The "good guys" and "bad guys" are also from Captain America 1. There were references to things that were going to happen in future films. There was a lot to think about. So it dawned on me that there wasn't anything on the internet that collected this mass of data into a helpful and simultaneously kick ass website for people to just explore and understand the bits and pieces. </p>

	<h2>Research</h2>
	<h3>Information + Inspiration</h3>
	<p>It was important to start collecting the facts that make up this magnificent world. As well as find out how other cinematic worlds handle this issue of representing their information. So I did three things. I scoured the internet for awesome websites, started watching all of the films over again, and made my "marvel sketchbook" to collect all of my findings. Starting from the front I collected data. Starting from the back I sketched inspiration. One day they will meet in the middle to form the final final product. </p>

	<h3>Boilind down the information</h3>
	<p>After figuring out what people wanted to know and how the internet handled like information, I saught to organize the information people wanted to know into larger categories since its more user friendly to have less options. It came down to 5 the 5 Ws.</p>
	<h4>who – characters</h4>
	<h4>what – characters</h4>
	<h4>where – locations</h4>
	<h4>when – timeline</h4>
	<h4>why – infinity stones</h4>

	<h2>Production</h2>
	<h3>Churning out the designs</h3>
	<h3>Organizing Characters</h3>
	<p>The first portion I tried to tackle was the characters. Initial reaction was to put all of the characters in one list but then I realized that in a 24 film/8 tv show franchise the character list would be ridiculous. So then I tried other methods. By franchise? But there were way to many franchises too. Heros + Villains? And then I realised what about Thor's girl friend? She's not a hero. So then Civilians came to being. And then I thought about Nick Fury. What did he fit into. He was more special than a civilian. So then I added S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents to the mix. And bam there were four categories.</p>
	<h4>Hero</h4>
	<h4>Villain</h4>
	<h4>S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent</h4>
	<h4>Civilians</h4>
	<h3>Visual Language</h3>
		<img src="images/AllCharacters.jpg" alt="The First Sketch">

	<h2>first concept</h2>
	<h3>The initial sketching phase</h3>
	<p>Here are the terrible first sketches I went through to get to the first tada moment. The following three are part of the first organization. Its the first full list, the hover statem and then full character profile.<br>This is also when I first attempted the colour pallet for franchises. I was definitely feeling that.</p>
		<div>
		<img src="images/idea1a.jpg" alt="the full list">
		<img src="images/idea1b.jpg" alt="the hover state">
		<img src="images/idea1c.jpg" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/idea2.jpg" alt="the character profile option 2">
	</div>
	<p>The following was the introduction of tabs. This was one of the original intents on tabed character profiles. I sort of liked it but not fully.</p>
		<div>
		<img src="images/idea3a.jpg" alt="the full list">
		<img src="images/idea3b.jpg" alt="the hover state">
		<img src="images/idea3c.jpg" alt="the character profile">
		</div>	
	<p>Ideas for the character list choises changed. I tested the idea of duotones again here. but also tried to see how it worked without it. The Gif part was that once you select a person from the list, it opens up and plays a gif.</p>
		<div>
		<img src="images/idea4a.jpg" alt="the full list">
		<img src="images/idea4b.jpg" alt="the hover state">
		<img src="images/idea4c.jpg" alt="the character profile">
		</div>
	<h3>The First aha moment</h3>
	<p>Toying with tabs I finally arrived at this final design. The background was designed to subtly move while the png of the character and the text stayed the same.</p>
		<div>
		<img src="images/idea5a.jpg" alt="the full list">
		<img src="images/idea5b.jpg" alt="the hover state">
		<img src="images/idea5c.jpg" alt="the character profile">
		</div>
	<h3>Meanwhile... the timeline</h3>
	<p>The timeline sort of happened separately and much more quickly than the character profile. The first sketch I came up with I hated. The second was basically a winner for me. And that became the final state for the Time line the first design round.</p>
		<div>
		<img src="images/Timeline1.jpg" alt="the full list">
		<img src="images/Timeline2.jpg" alt="the hover state">
		</div>
	<h3>The First aha:Timeline</h3>
		<div>
		<img src="images/Timeline3a.jpg" alt="the full list">
		<img src="images/Timeline3b.jpg" alt="the hover state">
		<img src="images/Timeline3c.jpg" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/Timeline3d.jpg" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/Timeline3e.jpg" alt="the character profile">

	<h2>Phase 2</h2>
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>I was reminded that this is a maginificent film franchise, it should feel more spectacular than just some wiki page. These are some of the initial sketches I came up with. I tried making the motion and visual organization more interesting. I wasn't fully sold on these ideas though. </p>
	<h3>Ideas</h3>
		<div>
		<img src="images/TestingA.jpeg" alt="the full list">
		<img src="images/TestingB.jpeg" alt="the hover state">
		<img src="images/TestingBB.jpeg" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/TestingBBB.jpeg" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/TestingC.jpeg" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/TestingCC.jpeg" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/TestingCCC.jpeg" alt="the character profile">
		</div>
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>I was told it needed more connectivity that everything felt very separate. Lightbulbs went off in my head and and I got to designing. </p>
	<h3>Full Page</h3>
	<p>The idea of letting the user see the full website upon landing hit me. It gave the idea of depth and multitude of information. I thought it would zoom in when you land, into the film profile page and that from there you could navigate through the drop down menu. I also was inspired by a website I found that used hovering on edges to pull in the next page. So I thought what if the edges were the differnt pages of the website. and hovering on the edges pulled in the different pages.</p>
		<div>
		<img src="images/LooknFeel-Full-05.png" alt="the full list">
		</div>
	<h3>Site Map</h3>
		<div>
		<img src="images/SiteMap-01.png" alt="the full list">
		<img src="images/SiteMap-02.png" alt="the hover state">
		<img src="images/SiteMap-03.png" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/SiteMap-04.png" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/SiteMap-05.png" alt="the character profile">
		<img src="images/SiteMap-06.png" alt="the character profile">
		</div>
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>A friend of mine asked me to think for a moment what the lay out of using the edge navication would look like in real life as a 3 dimensional object. How would it function. If I went from page A>B what would replace A on the edges? So we thought long and hard about how this organization worked in 3 dimensions. The Cube was the answer. </p>
