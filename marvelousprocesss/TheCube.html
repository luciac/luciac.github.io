	<h2>Phase 2</h2>
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>I was reminded that this is a maginificent film franchise, it should feel more spectacular than just some wiki page. These are some of the initial sketches I came up with. I tried making the motion and visual organization more interesting. I wasn't fully sold on these ideas though. </p>
	<h3>Ideas</h3>

	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>I was told it needed more connectivity that everything felt very separate. Lightbulbs went off in my head and and I got to designing. </p>
	<h3>Full Page</h3>
	<p>The idea of letting the user see the full website upon landing hit me. It gave the idea of depth and multitude of information. I thought it would zoom in when you land, into the film profile page and that from there you could navigate through the drop down menu. I also was inspired by a website I found that used hovering on edges to pull in the next page. So I thought what if the edges were the differnt pages of the website. and hovering on the edges pulled in the different pages.</p>

	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>A friend of mine asked me to think for a moment what the lay out of using the edge navication would look like in real life as a 3 dimensional object. How would it function. If I went from page A>B what would replace A on the edges? So we thought long and hard about how this organization worked in 3 dimensions. The Cube was the answer. </p>
