In a parallel universe. However one cannot get back because angels don't cry in the parallel universe, they party and play limbo. And they win. Which results in even more parties, which result in earthquakes. Sucks to be you if you get pulled into the bermuda triangle.</p>

        <p>Before chinchillas are born they are instilled with the knowledge of the meaning of life. However they are chinchillas and they cannot make sense of the information they have been gifted with, for they don't understand mandarin chinese (the language in which the information is given) or speak it to pass the information on to fellow chinese speaking creatures (homo sapiens). Nor do they understand the information in any way at all. Most of the time they do not even think about it.</p>

The unicorns became extinct centuries ago, but the tradition still carries on.</p>

      <p id="neuf">Once every 5 googleplex years a creature much resembling a narwhale, giraffe, jelly fish and wasp made of metal the size of a push pin crawls out of its natural habitat, the black hole, to find a mate. To mate they simply touch horns and the moment they touch horns, their opposing magnetism creates a massive explosion sending matter and space and time and magic flying in all directions. This could be the cause of the big bang, however several more years are needed to confirm this as the last living creature to witness this is most definitely dead from the blast.</p>

      <p id="dix">Adolf Hitler's neighbor stole the cookie from the cookie jar and blamed him. This is why baby Adolf grew up to be so angry and wrathful. Don't steal cookies. Don't blame innocent potential psychopaths. This childhood secret was discovered when a society of physchologists stole Hitler and hid him in an underground bunker, from then untill his death several years later, in order to study what makes a human so aweful. His captivity for observation is also why he was never found. There are other factors, but psychologists believe this cookie jar theif to be the root of all evil. The more "farout" psychologists believe that this cookie theif may even be the anti-christ. This isn't supported by all members of this secret society of psychologists.</p>
