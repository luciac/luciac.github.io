		21 secrets of the universe.
		
		1. When angels cry their tears fall from the heavens in the bermuda triangle and they're so powerful they send you flying to another time in the same bermuda triangle. in a parallel universe. However one cannot get back because angels don't cry in the parallel universe, they party and play limbo. And they win. Which results in even more parties, which result in earthquakes. Sucks to be you if you get pulled into the bermuda triangle. <br><br>
		2.Before chinchillas are born they are instilled with the knowledge of the meaning of life. However they are chinchillas and they cannot make sense of the information they have been gifted with, for they don't understand mandarin chinese (the language in which the information is given) or speak it to pass the information on to fellow chinese speaking creatures (homo sapiens). Nor do they understand the information in any way at all. Most of the time they do not even think about it.<br><br>
		3.Most people assume that the narwhale was the bastard offspring of the unicorns. Au contrair mes amis. The unicorn was the bastard child of narwhales. Thats why they don't exist anymore. Horses do not fare well in the depths of the oceans. Its a sad day for bastard children everywhere.<br><br>
		4. There is a tribe of eskimos that celebrate a holiday roughly translating to "Bastards' Day" where they make homemade horns out of various materials and dance in ice cold water in honour of the loss of unicorns. They became extinct centuries ago, but the tradition still carries on.<br><br>
		5. Alcohol is not from plants and fruits. It is dragon milk. It makes dragons grow up strong, but humans are no where near dragons, so it makes them stupid.<br><br>
