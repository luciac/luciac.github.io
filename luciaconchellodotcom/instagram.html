		<!--<h2>about the typeface</h2>-->
		<p>Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of all times in my own opinion. One of the aspects of his films that stands out most to me is his sense of layering. Layering is the underlying concept behind the entire box set from the box, to the catalogue. His films are reminiscent of film noir and arenâ€™t needlessly decorative. This is why the box was designed black and simple. The box contains three of his most layered films, at the time this set was made, 2016.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memento <span class="grey">(2000)</span>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inception <span class="grey">(2010)</span>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interstellar <span class="grey">(2014)</span>
		<br><br>
		Nolan is a man of old and practical tastes. He prefers the physical over the digital. He always films on film rather than digital. If he can build a set rather than do it in CG, he will absolutely do it, even if it seems impossible or more difficult. He is a man who appreciates the real and tactile. So a hand crafted physically interactive DVD box set and catalogue was the best way to pay homage to the cinematic genius who brought the world so many amazing films.</p>
		
		
		<p>The closing spread of the book, talks about his use of multiple layers throughout his films. And so this final spread breaks its content into multiple layers.
		<br><br><br>
		It is really quite difficult to really recreate the experience of openening and exploring the catalogue digitally. The experience would be entirely different. The gifs are there to show you the design. <!--But if you're a film or Christopher Nolan fanatic as I am, and/or are curious to read the catalogue, <a href="">read it here!</a> But when you do, remember, I am a designer, not a writer. :)--></p>
