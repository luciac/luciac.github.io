		<h2>a book of two letters</h2>
		<p>This title-less book is a metaphor for human ignorance. It contains only two letters from Kurt Vonnegut. 
		<br><br>
		The first letter, only legible on the “So it goes” side, is a letter from young Kurt Vonnegut to his family explaining that all throughout his time in WWII everyone around him died but not him. The events he describes in this letter were a direct inspiration for his popular novel Slaughterhouse-Five. This is paired with the quote “So it goes.” from that novel, which he says every time some one dies.
		<br><br>
		The second letter, only legible from the other side, is from a much older Vonnegut to the dean of a high school that burned Slaughterhouse-Five in its furnaces for being immoral, depraved, and anti-christian. In this letter he defends himself as an author and his work. He also points out to the dean of the school that burning books is a sign of ignorance. On the cover of this side is a quote laser burned into it, also from Slaughterhouse-Five. A quote which drove the entire design of this book: “But among them was this poor earthing, and his head was encased… There was only one eyehole through which he could look.” This was a quote from an alien attempting to describe the ignorance of human perception..</p>

		<p>I physically manifested this quote into a book in which you could only read one line of text at a time forcing the reader to experience this sense of ignorance themselves.</p>
