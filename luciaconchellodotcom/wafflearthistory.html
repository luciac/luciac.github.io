		<h2>about this project</h2>
		<p>It's really quite simple. In my spare time, to keep myself entertained and continue to appreciate art history, I recreate famous works of art with waffles. So far, I've done pop art, but there will be plenty more to come.</p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 1:  Andy Warhol</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">October 18 2017.</span> <br>This was the first waffle I worked on. And it was just on a whim at first. A friend told me to draw a waffle, and I began to envision all the ways that a waffle could be done. And then imagined how other artists would do waffles. And this was the first of its kind. I rememberd the Velvet Underground banana Warhol made. I was torn between making a full on eggo box in honor of his brillo boxes, but since it was the first one and just a fun little idea, in the end it was just a drawing in my sketch book. The color pallet was taken from his works.<br><br></p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 2:  Roy Lichtenstein</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">October 23 2017.</span> <br>The Litchenstein waffle was still in the beginning, quick sketch, phases of this side project. I observed how text and color were used in his appropriations to draw this composition to encompass the feel.<br><br></p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 3:  Keith Haring</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">November 1 2017.</span> <br>This is the point in the project where I was starting to get very into it. After having made the Wharhol and Lichtenstein waffles, I made a list of famous pop art artists. Keith Haring was an obivous one to immediately go onto the list. His figures were so simplistic they spoke to so many people. The dancing harring waffle was born.<br><br></p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 4:  Jasper Johns</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">November 7 2017</span> <br>Jasper Johns' work was so simple that it stuck with me since I took art history in college. When I added his name to the pop art list, his Target paintings sprang immediately to mind. "I made the flags and targets to open men's eyes.. ..[they] were both things - which are seen and not looked at - examined." The waffle, a simple delicious breakfast meal, too sometimes goes seen but not looked at. This was made not with melted wax like his original, as these are made on a much smaller scale, but with layers of acrylic paint to mimic the look. It was at this point int the project I was beinging to more recreate work rather than encapsul its style.<br><br></p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 5:  Takashi Murakami</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">November 13 2017</span> <br>Takashi Murakami just happened to have an exhibit in the MFA that had just opened the month before. The original piece this was adapted from was Summer Vacation in the Kingdom of the Golden 2008, which was displayed grandly in the exhibit. I was drawn to making a waffle verson of his work because he is so recent. So many pop artists are past now. Murakami, though, is in his prime. His work is so reflective of japanese culture and so bright, it truly feels unlike a lot of other pop art I'd seen traditionally. This was done with actual gold leaf, like the original. It was much fun to work on, and seemed too easy to translate into waffle land.<br><br></p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 6: Yayoi Kusuma</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">November 20 2017</span> <br>WORDS ABOUT KUSUMAAAAAA. I didn't have these colored stickers readily available. I did, however, have many large sheets of different colored post-its. So i spent the (long amounts of) time to cut and correctly color many, many, many "stickers" for this waffle iteration.<br><br></p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 7: James Rosenquist</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">November 24 2017</span> <br>A name I need to google every time I have to spell it. This one was so incredibly fun to recreate. The subject matter that got replaced was so fitting. The cake so easily replaceable with a waffle. And the newly elected president so easily replaced with another very newly elected president. Rosenquist's original piece was about a man who advertised himself. He was obsessed with presidency in the relatively new age of television and mass marketing. It felt so fitting to replace him with Trump, a president who also advertised himslef in the relatively new age of social media.<br><br></p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 8: James Rosenquist</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">November 26 2017</span> <br>Jeff Koons. There are several opinions of Koons. One of the major complains is how "gaudy" and "kitch" some of his work looks for being fine art. He takes the mundane and makes it larger than life. He takes the light and gives it weight. He takes the small and insignificant and makes it large and important. So a giant metallic waffle was the way to go. Since I couldn't figure out a way to physically make a waffle as reflective as his metalic sculptures, I learned to 3d model for the first time. If I say so myself, for having learned and finished this in about one weekend, I am very impressed. (pats myself on the back)<br><br></p>

		<h2>pop art waffle 9: Claes Oldenburg</h2>
		<p><span class="grey">December 27 2017</span> <br>This one took forever because I really did "sow" a head sized waffle, though I only did one side. Those inverted squares were a pain to do. I also say sow in parathenses because I actually used glue to save massive amounts of time and I didn't know how to sow. <br><br></p>
